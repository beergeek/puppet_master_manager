## Overview

A module to manage active/passive master pair in PE3.7.1.

## Module Description

Module setups incrond and Postgresql dumps on Active.

Module manages certificates on Passive.

## Setup

### What puppet_master_manager affects

* incrond and job on Active
* Cron jobs for Postgresql dump on Active
* Classifier, Dashbaord and Postgresql certs on Passive

### Setup Requirements

#### Active Master

Perform an all-in-one installation via an answers file.
Access to EPEL repos.

#### Passive Master

Copy the Active Master's answers file to the Passive Master.
Replace all instances of the Active Master's hostname with the Passive's
Install Puppet.
Edit the puppet.conf and set the server variable in the `agent` section to be
the active Puppet master, e.g. `server = active.puppetlabs.vm`.
Remove the `server` entry from the `main` section.
Ensure dns_alt_names are included.
Remove SSL directory on completion.
Run Puppet on the passive master and sign the certificate on the active master

### Beginning with puppet_master_manager

Classify active and passive masters with `puppet_master_manager`:

```puppet
    class { 'puppet_master_manager':
      active_master   => 'active.puppetlabs.vm',
      passive_master  => 'passive.puppetlabs.vm',
      rsync_user      => 'root',
    }
```

To enable replication:

```puppet
    class { 'puppet_master_manager':
      enable_replication  => true,
      active_master       => 'active.puppetlabs.vm',
      passive_master      => 'passive.puppetlabs.vm',
      replication_address => '10.0.0.1/32',
    }
```
